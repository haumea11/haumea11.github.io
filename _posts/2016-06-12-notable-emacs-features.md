## An introduction

Hey all,

This is an attempt to make a post about my emacs setup and why I (a
vim guy) now use emacs.  Has that been done before, by someone much
better with emacs than I am in a talk format?  Yes, but ignore that
for a second.  As someone who really does think emacs-style chording
isn't pleasant (and prefers modal editing Ã  la vim) I still think
there's potential in the "editor" we call emacs.

## First, why emacs?

So, my real reasons for switching to emacs were twofold.  Let's look
into them:

### Org-mode

This was the first, and biggest, reason I made the jump to emacs.
[Org-mode](http://orgmode.org/worg/) is an outline system, a
todo-management program, a LaTeX-exporter, a scheduling and
agenda-making utility, a spreadsheet editor, a blog-posting and
wiki-editing utility, and likely a half dozen other things I can't
remember off the top of my head.
